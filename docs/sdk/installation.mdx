<Steps>
<Step title="Prerequisites">

Before installing the TakeProfit Widget SDK, ensure that you meet the following requirements:

- **Package Manager**: The SDK is distributed via npm, so you should have either **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **yarn** installed.
- **Project Setup**: Ensure you have an existing project directory with a basic configuration, such as a `package.json` file. If not, you can create one with:

  ```bash
  npm init -y
  ```

</Step>

<Step title="Install the SDK">

The TakeProfit Widget SDK is available as an npm package. To install it, run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm install takeprofit-widget-sdk
```

If you prefer using `yarn`, you can install it with:

```bash
yarn add takeprofit-widget-sdk
```

This command will add the SDK as a dependency in your `package.json` file and download it to the `node_modules` directory.

### Verifying Installation

After installation, you should see `takeprofit-widget-sdk` listed under `"dependencies"` in your `package.json` file, like this:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "takeprofit-widget-sdk": "^0.2.3"
}
```

_Note_: Replace `^0.2.3` with the version number you have installed.

</Step>

<Step title="Initialize the SDK in Your Project">

Once installed, you can begin using the SDK by importing it into your project files. Here’s a simple setup example:

1. **Import the SDK**: Open the main file where you intend to initialize the SDK (e.g., `index.js`, `app.js`, or `main.ts`) and import the SDK:

   ```javascript
   import { TPWidgetSDK } from "takeprofit-widget-sdk";
   ```

2. **Basic Initialization**: To ensure the SDK is correctly initialized, call the `connect` method when your widget is ready to communicate with the platform:

   ```javascript
   TPWidgetSDK.connect();
   ```

3. **Hiding the Loader**: To let the TakeProfit platform know your widget is ready, use the `hideLoader` function after initialization:

   ```javascript
   TPWidgetSDK.hideLoader();
   ```

This confirms that the SDK is successfully integrated and your widget can begin communicating with the platform.

</Step>

<Step title="Verify Installation">

After setting up the SDK in your project, follow these steps to verify that it’s working correctly:

1. **Test Initialization**:

   - Run your project (typically with `npm start` or `yarn start`).
   - Check the browser’s developer console to ensure there are no errors related to `takeprofit-widget-sdk`.

2. **Local Storage Configuration** (for local widget testing):

   - Open [Take Profit Platform](https://takeprofit.com/platform) in your browser.
   - Open your browser’s console and set up a local storage entry for your widget to test it on the TakeProfit platform interface.
   - Run this command in the browser console:

     ```javascript
     localStorage.setItem(
     	"takeprofit.integrations.third_party_widget_options",
     	JSON.stringify([
     		{
     			iframeUrl: "<your iframe URL>",
     			enableChannelSupport: false,
     			title: "Test Widget",
     			imageUrl: "<icon URL>",
     		},
     	])
     );
     ```

   - Replace `<your iframe URL>` and `<icon URL>` with the actual URLs for testing.
   - Reload the page and verify that your widget appears in the TakeProfit widget panel.

</Step>
</Steps>
