title: Introduction
description: The TakeProfit Widget SDK is a tool designed to help developers create and integrate interactive, data-driven widgets directly into the TakeProfit platform. Widgets embedded with this SDK can communicate with the platform, exchange data, and offer seamless, customized experiences for users.

## Key Components

The SDK includes several key components that serve as the building blocks for widget integration:

- **TPWidgetSDK**: The primary object for interacting with the platform. It includes methods for initializing, connecting, and managing widget states.

- **Interfaces and Types**: The SDK provides a comprehensive set of interfaces, such as `Channel`, `Security`, which define the structure of data used within the platform and ensure type safety.

- **Messaging System**: The SDK’s messaging system allows widgets to send and receive messages for updating states, changing securities, managing menus, and other interactive functionalities.

## How the SDK Works

The TakeProfit Widget SDK works by embedding widgets within the TakeProfit platform via an iframe.

Widgets can:

- **Subscribe to Updates**: Track platform data like security changes and channel updates.
- **Send Requests**: Request state changes (e.g., switch securities or update widget settings).
- **Receive Events**: Handle platform events and user interactions to provide a cohesive experience.

### Example Use Cases

1. **Custom Security Data**: Create a widget that displays real-time stock data, allowing users to switch between different securities.
2. **Interactive Dashboards**: Build an interactive widget that synchronizes with the platform’s channels, updating based on user selections.
3. **Menu Management**: Add custom menu items to the widget for easy access to specific actions or settings.
