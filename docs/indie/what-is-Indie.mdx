**Indie** is a _technical analysis-oriented_ programming language and runtime for developing indicators for the
TakeProfit platform. All built-in indicators on the platform are implemented in Indie, and TakeProfit has integrated IDE
tools that allow users to create their own indicators.

Indie is a dialect of Python and is essentially a subset of Python language constructs, with added [syntactic
sugar](How-Indies-syntactic-sugar-works) in the form of decorators (such as `@indicator` or `@algorithm`) and a few
differences in semantics. You can learn more about these differences in [this
section](Language-differences-with-Python).

For a quick understanding of the Indie code, it is recommended to go directly to the [Quick start](Quick-start) chapter.

As a product of TakeProfit, Indie is under ongoing development and many new features and capabilities are expected to be
added in the future.
